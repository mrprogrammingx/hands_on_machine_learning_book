# Hands-On Machine Learning – Practice & Exercises

This repository contains my practice solutions and project implementations based on the book **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow** by Aurélien Géron.  
The goal is to deepen understanding by solving exercises, coding examples, and applying concepts to real code.
